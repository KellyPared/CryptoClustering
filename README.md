# CryptoClustering
Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes

This app uses scikitlearn to prefrom an unsupervised learning script of bitcoin data.

In this project, I used elbow curves, k-means clustering, and PCA clustering to analyze Bitcoins. The goal of this analysis was to gain insights into the patterns and relationships in the Bitcoin data and to identify any potential trends or clusters.

To analyze the Bitcoin data, I used elbow curves to determine the optimal number of clusters for k-means clustering. After identifying the optimal number of clusters, I performed k-means clustering to group similar Bitcoin data points into clusters based on their similarity. I then visualized the clusters using scatter plots and identified any patterns or trends.

Finally, I used PCA clustering to reduce the dimensionality of the Bitcoin data and visualize the relationships between variables in a lower-dimensional space. This involved projecting the data onto a smaller number of principal components and creating a scatter plot to show how the data points are distributed in this reduced dimensional space.

The analysis using elbow curves, k-means clustering, and PCA clustering provided insights into the patterns and relationships in the Bitcoin data. The results showed the optimal number of clusters for the Bitcoin data.

This analysis can be useful for understanding the market trends and identifying potential opportunities in the Bitcoin market.
